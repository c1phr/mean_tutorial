If you're interested in learning more, here's some things worth checking out:

* [Mongoose Documentation](http://mongoosejs.com) - Mongoose is a pretty powerful database driver, and we only barely scratched the surface.
* [Thinkster](https://thinkster.io) - Full disclosure: I'm not a huge fan of Thinkster. That being said, they have some good tutorials if you 
know what you're looking for.
* [MongoDB Website](https://www.mongodb.org) - If you're fascinated by the idea of NoSQL databases like me, MongoDB's website is a good place to learn more.
