##  npm

Node.JS comes with an incredibly powerful package manager called NPM (Node Package Manager). 
This is similar to NuGet for .NET or PIP for Python packages, and we're going to use NPM a few times to help us get our site setup. 
******
NPM is accessed through the command line or terminal depending on your operating system. 
There is no native UI, though a list of packages can be found at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com).
