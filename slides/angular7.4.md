##  Some more angular directives

* `ng-repeat` - This is similar to a for loop in Angular. It will iterate through the elements in the collection and repeat the 
markup for each element. In this case, we use it to repeat table rows for users.
* `ng-submit` - Refers to the controller function that will be called on form submit.
* `ng-model` - Assigns a name to the data that is submitted from the input field for referral in the Angular controller.
