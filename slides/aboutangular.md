## Angular JS

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) is a front-end framework written by Google. Originally, AngularJS was written as a way to make HTML "smarter" 
by giving it features that would allow it to fit better in the world of web applications. 

AngularJS v1 was notorious for being a complex beast
that was difficult to learn. As a result of the feedback from the original AngularJS, Google has been working on [AngularJS v2](https://angular.io) 
that will hopefully be released leater this year.
