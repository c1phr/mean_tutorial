##  Stay Away From

Here's a few resources that you probably won't want to look at

* [Mean.io](http://mean.io/#!/) - You're probably wondering why this is here, considering this is a tutorial on MEAN. 
Mean.io is a website about a tool that helps bootstrap a MEAN stack project. Unfortunately, its documentation is extremely poor, it can 
include many things in your project that you simply don't care about and it's heavily opinionated toward creating packages and hosting them in 
their own package manager (separate from NPM). Mean.io is created by a company that specialized in creating MEAN websites for clients (for profit), 
so their intentions and future are questionable. It's entirely possible to create a MEAN stack application without the Mean.io CLI, and you've done it if you went through this tutorial.
