##  Mongo DB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org) is a popular NoSQL document-based database. It's fast, scales easily, and is incredibly flexible.

MongoDB works by storing data in "collections" (rather than structured tables) where collections store the same type
of data. Collections do not enforce any strucutre on the data within them, only documents enforce their own structure.

Generally, NoSQL promotes quick interation by making database structure changes simple and database interaction is object oriented
from the beginning. NoSQL typically provides "auto-sharding" making horizontal scaling simple.
