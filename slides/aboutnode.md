## Node JS

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) is the platform that brings all of these technologies together. NodeJS is a standalone implementation of 
Google's V8 JavaScript engine that can be used to write all sorts of applications. Nearly everything in this project is a direct result
of the existence of NodeJS.

NodeJS is event-driven and non-blocking that makes it lightweight, while still being relatively scalable across multiple CPUs. This scalability
does require programmers to be careful however, as there is just one main event-loop thread that can be blocked.
