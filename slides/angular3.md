##  AngularJS

Create a new folder inside `public` called "`js`" and inside of that folder, create a new file called `angularApp.js`. This is 
where we'll store our Angular code.

Don't forget to add a link to the new file in your `index.ejs` file that we were just working with.

`<script src="/js/angularApp.js">< /script>` 

> I know this path seems wrong, but remember that the server will render from the root directory, not from the views directory where the 
templates are stored.
